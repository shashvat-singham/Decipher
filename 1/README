To run the code you will need a quadgram file. We couldn't submit it in the submission folder because
moodle doesn't allow submissions more than 1MB size.

Download quadgram file from:
http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/letter-frequencies-various-languages/english-letter-frequencies/#quadgram-frequencies
and put it in the same folder as decryption codes. Name it as quadgrams.txt
